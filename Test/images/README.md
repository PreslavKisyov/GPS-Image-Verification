# THIS IS THE README FOR THE IMAGES FOLDER #
This folder contains 4 test images which the model can be tested on. The images are grouped in two
pairs - Query and Reference, and they must be passed in that order through the verificationTool.py model.
The images are picked to test both Template Matching and Patch Matching methods.
image1Q.jpg + image1R.jpg - Designed to test the Template Matching<br/>
image2Q.jpg + image2R.jpg - Designed to test the Patch Matching<br/>
These images were picked randomly and are part of the two datasets used to test the model, as per the paper of this project.
